Hello earthlings 👋, I'm Diego a freelance software developer to serve you.
A professional try-outer, an amateur migrant, and somewhat courious.

My career is mostly focused in line-of-business apps many of them in C#.
AJAXing before XHR, with framesets (oh, do you remember them? 👴 thanks Microsoft for making OWA).
C# is one of two loved languages, the other one is JavaScript (I really like it!)

SO, skills list:

 - good knowledge of design patterns 🧑‍💼
 - databases SQL and NO-SQL (💗 with Microsoft SQL Server and MongoDB, open minded, but not to Oracle - I already worked with it, it's terribly unfriendly)
 - AGILE, yeah, mosty SCRUM (really, I only worked twice with companies that were really agile, most say they are, but they are not)
 - C#: ASP.NET, Razor, Blazor (ooh razor-blade?), WebForms (even in .NET 1.1! AJAXing in 1.1 was fun 😉), WPF, Xamarin
   even IL-emitting for doing dark-magic with reflection, LINQ, anything else? Oh, yeah, Entity Framework, SignalR, NHibernate...
   I worked with a lot of stuff, ask me if it's not listed
 - HTML: I've been with it since before jQuery (the greatest relief!). Frameworks: Ract, Vue, 💗 AngularJS and 💗 Angular, 💗 having a crush with Svelte
 - CSS: I do know how to fix webpages, not how to do those super-fancy animations, just basic animations.
 - Flutter: 😶‍🌫️ just a little
 - some knowledge on networks: 📡 implemented support for IS-IS and some basic RSVP-TE in JavaScript
 - Docker, containers: I've worked with containers since before 🐋 Docker =D, so: Docker is easy. Once I used them to standardise the development environment with a web IDE in the project I was leading, that ended up being a really good move for the case. Also, 💗 loved RedHat's OpenShift. I believe Kubernetes isn't the right tool for the most cases it is in use: overly complex, usually not needed.

But I've "derailed" in my free time a little building some stuff:

 - 🏥 a medical app prototype using Kinect for Windows (many people did one of those)
 - 💶 a kiosk framework in Android that you could feed with coins and bills and get a ticket
 - 🥗 a classic app for restaurants 
 - 🧑‍💻 an offline IDE written in angular with automatic data and code syncing, templating and a few other tricks which automatically produced PWAs and had live previewing (while keeping the model! it was really useful to open multiple windows and modify the HTML/CSS/JS and see it instantly apply, while being offline in a browser)
 - 🚚 (sadly, unreleased) a market plus logistics application to coordinate multipoint deliveries
 - 📷 a functional mock of a famous social network (I wanted to learn svelte)
 - 🐕 (discontinued) an app to quickly find and report lost dogs in a map
 - 📨 a messaging bus for microservices written in JS
 - 💡 (this one is a classic): reverse engineered my *cheap* Bluetooth lightbulbs protocol (someone did that for
   a similar model, but I had to re-do all of it) and implemented a controller with a Raspberry and a remote
   control with a ESP32 (with an M5Stack)
 - 💻 once I fixed a laptop BIOS (had to reverse engineer the code to understand where the temperature values
   were hardcoded, learn a enough of ACPI source language to do that, figure out that Microsoft ASL compiler
   doesn't work that well, the Intel one does work, such an adventure!)
 - 🏠 now I am doing a little bit of an app to find the best next home for anyone
 - 🖥️ created a app-templating system with LXC/LXD - similar to docker, before it existed
 - Android apps: 🤳 one old one for travelling salesmen that synced up prices and orders back when 2G coverage was scarse, with a backend written in Java for Google App Engine

Next:
 
 - 🧠 I have to get ready to learn some serious AI

Books I liked (in the same theme):

 - [The man from the Future](https://leer.amazon.es/kp/embed?asin=B08X6QLFSC&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_VMRAVM8DSJ8X6T5S9ZD3)
   A biography John von Neumann 
 - [Androids](https://leer.amazon.es/kp/embed?asin=B09QPMNWS5&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_S81QNZJZ9CB6YG6ZDYGJ)
   Stories of the Android operating system developemnt, from the very start

BTW, I'm a heavy Linux user - my first distro was Slackware 2.1 =/ waaaay back then
when I had to look at the refresh rate of my monitor in the backplate for a text-based 60+ questions.
